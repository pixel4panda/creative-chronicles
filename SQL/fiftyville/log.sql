        -- morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street
        -- and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
        -- Raymond : As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them
        -- for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to
        -- take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on
        -- the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
