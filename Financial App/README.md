#### Description:
Ideally my app starts as a financial tracking app for myself. I am looking into the possibility of expanding it and letting friends try it out too.

I wanted it to have a plant theme, because I like plants. So I used a plant for a logo and tried to keep my colors to an earthy / green tone

## Project Features:

TODO 
- Add, edit, and delete transactions
- Categorize income and expenses
- Automatically update account balances and store them in a monthly history.
- Pagination for

#### Design Decisions:

In research I found that when handling money a common workaround it to use INTEGER instead of FLOAT to avoid rounding errors. So everything is multiplied by 100 when storing values and divided by 100 when displaying. 

**see money_func.py for further information*

## app.py

### Application Setup

Flask app configured with session support using `flask_session`.

Custom Jinja filters: `money` and `m_display`.

*The necessity for two different filters came from using money as an input, where only numbers are needed and using money as an information for the reader, where the '$' symbol is required for clear readability.*

All responses are configured to not cache `(after_request)`.

Database connection via `get_db()` and closed with `close_db()`.

>Authentication helper functions: `login_required`, `user_error`.  
>Libraries: `Flask`, `flask_session`, `sqlite3`, `werkzeug.security`

### @index()  

This route redirects the user to the dashboard if they are already logged in, otherwise, it prompts the login page.  

It checks for a `user_id` in the session and redirects accordingly 

**Key Points:** 
1. Checks session to determine if user is logged in.  
2. Redirects to `/dashboard` for authenticated users.  
3. Redirects to `/login` for unauthenticated users.  

>Tables: None  
>Depends on: `redirect`, `session`

### @login()  

Handles user login: displays the login page on GET requests and processes authentication on POST requests.

On POST, it validates the submitted email and password, checks credentials against the database, and sets the session `user_id` on success. 

**Key Points:**  
1. Clears any existing session before login.  
2. Validates form inputs (`email`, `password`).  
3. Checks credentials against `users` table and sets `session["user_id"]`.  
4. Redirects to `/dashboard` on successful login; otherwise calls `user_error`.

>Tables: `users`  
>Depends on: `check_password_hash`, `get_db()`, `redirect`, `render_template`, `session`, `user_error`, `url_for`

### @logout()  

Logs the user out by clearing the session and redirects to the index route.

**Key Points:**  
1. Clears all session data.  
2. Redirects user to `index()`, which will then send them to `login()` if unauthenticated

>Tables: None  
>Depends on: `redirect`, `session`

### @register()  

Handles user registration: displays the registration form on GET requests and processes new user creation on POST requests.

**Key Points:**  
1. Validates all form fields.  
2. Checks if passwords match and email is not already registered.
3. Inserts new user into `users` table with `generate_password_hash`.
4. Flashes success message and redirects to `/login`.

>Tables: `users`  
>Depends on: `flash`, `get_db()`, `generate_password_hash`, `redirect`, `render_template`, `user_error`, `url_for`

### @dashboard()  

Displays the user’s dashboard. Currently under development. 

**Key Points:**  
1. Intended to show a summary of accounts, spending, and other metrics in the future.

>Tables: None  
>Depends on: `render_template`

[Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### @accounts()  

Displays the user’s account balances for Sprouting and Grounded accounts. Allows viewing balances by year and automatically ensures the current month is computed. 

This route fetches account balances from the `account_balances` table, splits accounts into Sprouting and Grounded classifications, organizes them by month, and computes totals for each month. 

**Key Points:**  
1. Determines the selected year from query parameters or defaults to the current year.
2. Automatically calls `archive_month()` to compute account totals and save monthly balances in data history.
3. Fetches and organizes Sprouting and Grounded accounts into dictionaries keyed by account ID.
4. Computes totals per month for both account classifications.

>Tables: `accounts`, `account_balances`, `account_types`  
>Depends on: `archive_month()`, `datetime`, `defaultdict`, `get_db()`,   `render_template`, `session`

### @edit_account()  

Allows users to manage their existing accounts: edit details, close, recover, or create new ones.

This route handles both open and closed accounts, updates monthly balances accordingly, and maintains historical accuracy via `archive_month()`.

**Key Points:**  
1. Supports updating account type, name, or balance for all open accounts.
2. Allows closing or recovering accounts without losing transaction history.
3. Automatically updates `account_balances` for the current month upon any edit.
4. Validates account types and balance formats before committing changes.
5. Adds new accounts with a unique name and type combination per user.
6. Uses `m_read()` for computing and `m_display()` for formatting balances.

>Tables: `accounts`, `account_balances`, `account_types`  
>Depends on: `archive_month()`, `datetime`, `defaultdict`, `flash`, `get_db()`, `m_display()`, `m_read`, `render_template`, `redirect`, `session`, `timedelta`, `url_for`

**Key Points:**  
1. Accepts a cat_id parameter from the URL to identify the active category.
2. Loads the selected category and all its subcategories for editing.
3. Prevents duplicate category and subcategory names per user.
4. Prevents category deletion if there are existing subcategories in it.
5. Prevents subcategory deletion if linked to transactions. 
6. Supports moving subcategories between categories.
7. Automatically refreshes the page after any change for accurate state.

>Depends on: `flash`, `get_db()`, `render_template`, `redirect`, `session`, `url_for`

[Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### @transactions()

This route handles displaying, loading and deleting transactions.

It fetches categories, subcategories and open accounts - so only open accounts can be selected by the user when inputting new transactions; supports pagination of 30 items at a time; and recalculates account balances when a transaction is deleted.

**Key Points:**                
1. Loads transactions in steps of 30 (`offset` + `Load More`).
2. Joins `transactions`, `accounts`,`account_types` to create a `defaultdict` to be passed to the template.
3. Deletes transactions on POST and updates balances and monthly archives through `archive_month()`

>Tables: `accounts`, `account_types`, `categories`, `subcategories`, `transactions`  
>Depends on: `archive_month()`, `flash`, `get_db()`, `redirect`,  `render_template`, `session`, `url_for`

### @get_subcategories(category_id)

This route returns all subcategories from a category for the logged user.

It prompts the database for subcategories matching the `category_id` and `user_id`, orders them alphabetically, and converts them into a JSON format to be sent to the front-end.

*see transactions.html for further information*

**Key Points:**               
1. Lists subcategories alphabetically (`ASC`), for a given `category_id` from the `user_id` passed through the `session`.
2. Converts SQLite rows into dictionaries and returns them as JSON.

>Tables: `subcategories`   
>Depends on: `get_db()`, `jsonify`, `session`

### @new_transaction()

This route creates a new transaction without reloading the page.

It validates all fields, checks if the selected account is open, determines amount sign based on `flow` classification of transactions and account classification (`Grounded` or `Sprouting`), and updates monthly balances through `archive_month()`.

**Key Points:**                
1. Validates all inputs and ensures the account belongs to the user.
2. Uses `m_read()` to compute the amount value.
3. Adjusts transaction sign according to flow and account type.
4. Updates historical balances for the month and returns a JSON response.

>Tables: `accounts`, `account_types`, `transactions`  
>Depends on: `archive_month()`, `datetime`, `get_db()`, `jsonify`,  `m_read()`, `session`

### @edit_transaction(tr_id)

This route edits an existing transaction without reloading the page.

It compares the new values to the existing record, updates changed fields, and recalculates affected monthly archives / account balances for both the original and new transaction dates.

**Key Points:**                
1. Validates all inputs and ensures the transaction exists.
2. Recomputes signs for amounts based on flow and account type.
3. Commits only if any changes are detected.
4. Calls `archive_month()` for both new and old dates if the transaction date changes.

### @monthly()

This route displays a monthly summary of income and expenses per subcategory for a selected year.

It compiles transaction data for each subcategory, calculating net totals (income minus expenses) for every month of the chosen year — including the previous December as a starting point. It organizes results into a structured dictionary, along with user-specific category and subcategory, and renders them in the monthly reports template.

**Key Points:**                
1. Retrieves available years from `account_balances` and selects the active year from form select or defaults to the current year.
2. Fetches all user categories and subcategories to build a `defaultdict` of subcategory totals per month (0–12, where 0 = previous December).
3. Computes monthly net totals (`income` - `expense`) using SQL.
4. Passes structured data to the template for display.

>Tables: `account_balances`, `categories`, `subcategories`, `transactions`  
>Depends on: `datetime`, `defaultdict`, `get_db()`, `render_template`, `session`

### @yearly()

This route displays a yearly summary of income and expenses per subcategory for as long as the user has records.

It compiles transaction data for each subcategory, calculating net totals (income minus expenses) for every year available. It organizes results into a structured dictionary, along with user-specific category and subcategory, and renders them in the yearly reports template.

**Key Points:**                
1. Retrieves all distinct years recorded in `account_balances` and lists them in descending order.
2. Fetches all user categories and subcategories to build a `defaultdict` of subcategory totals per year.
3. Computes yearly net totals (`income` - `expense`) using SQL.
4. Passes structured data to the template for display.

## sub-folder: accounts
        
### accounts.html

Displays a yearly summary of all user accounts, separated into two classes: Sprouted (assets) and Grounded (liabilities). The decison to name them like that came from my plant theme. 

Allows selection of other years and provides link to add or edit accounts. 

**Key Points:**  
1. Fetches and display monthly balances from previous December and January through December of the current year. 

    *This design decision came from my habit of comparing account totals to previous months; whenever there is a change in year, I always find myself comparing how balances transitioned.* 

2. Totals for each month are shown at the bottom of each table.  
3. Two main tables: Sprouted (accounts for assets) and Grounded (accounts for liability)
4. Includes "+" button linking to `/edit_account` route for adding / editing accounts.

### set_categories.html

Displays all categories and their respective subcategories in a summarized, read-only layout.

*Instead of placing all category and subcategory editing tools on one page, I intentionally separated them to reduce confusion when managing nested data in the backend. It also avoids the need to scroll through a long, crowded form.*

Provides quick access to edit each category and the ability to create a new one.

**Key Points:**  
1. Lists all categories with their nested subcategories indented underneath.
2. Each category includes an Edit button that navigates to its detailed editing page.

## sub-folder: transactions
### transactions.html

Displays all user transactions (both income and expenses) in an interactive table.

Users can view, add, edit, or delete transactions directly from this page using modal windows.

*The modals allowed me to handle the add / edit transaction actions separately in the backend and avoid full page reloads*

**Key Points:**  
1. Lists every transaction with fields for type, amount, category, subcategory, account, date, and action buttons (Edit / Delete).
2. Closed-account transactions appear grayed out and uneditable.
3. Includes a “Load More” button for pagination.
4. The "Add New" button opens the `#newTransactionModal`.
5. The "Edit" button opens the `#editTransactionModal` , which is prefilled with existing data from the database.
6. Subcategories on both modals are automatically populated upon selection of category. 
7. JavaScript reloads the full table upon modal sucessful form submission. 

>Extends: `layout.html`  
>Variables used: `accounts`, `categories`, `load_more`, `offset`, `subcategories`, `transactions`  
>Filters Used: `m_display`  
>Depends on: `url_for('transactions')`, `/subcategories/<category_id>`, `/transactions/new`, `/transactions/edit/<id>`

**Supporting Scripts**

<ins>Dynamic Subcategory fetching</ins> 

A JavaScript event listener monitors all `<select name="category">` elements.

When the user changes a category, a `fetch('/subcategories/<category_id>')` call retrieves the relevant subcategories and repopulates the dropdown list in real time.

<ins>Populate Edit Transaction Modal</ins>

When the user clicks an "Edit" button, JavaScript retrieves all data attributes from that transaction. These values are automatically filled into the `editTransactionForm`

If the associated account is closed, editing is blocked and the user receives an alert. 

<ins>Handle New Transaction Submission</ins>

The “Save New Transaction” button sends the newTransactionForm data via `fetch('/transactions/new')`.

The server responds with JSON indicating success or error. 

On success, the modal closes and the table reloads.

<ins>Handle Edit Transaction Submission</ins>

The “Save Edit Transaction” button sends the editTransactionForm data via `fetch('/transactions/edit/<tr_id>')`.

The form includes validation for missing IDs. The server responds with JSON indicating success or error. 

On success, the modal closes and the table reloads.

### dashboard.html

This page is still under development. Eventually it will allow users to see a short summary of their current month's spending and maybe I will add a mascot here. 

Key Points:  
1. Placeholder text and comments are in place for future content.
2. Will extend `layout.html` once fully developed.
